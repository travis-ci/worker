	// 10 kB since that is smaller). Looking at the travis-logs source, the
	// current message overhead (i.e. the part of the payload that isn't
	// the content of the log part) is 42 bytes + the length of the JSON-
	// encoded ID and the length of the JSON-encoded sequence number. A 64-
	// bit number is up to 20 digits long, so that means (assuming we don't
	// go over 64-bit numbers) the overhead is up to 82 bytes. That means
	// we can send up to 9918 bytes of content. However, the JSON-encoded
	// version of a string can be significantly longer than the raw bytes.
	// Worst case that I could find is "<", which with the Go JSON encoder
	// becomes "\u003c" (i.e. six bytes long). So, given a string of just
	// left angle brackets, the string would become six times as long,
	// meaning that the longest string we can take is 1653. We could still
	// get errors if we go over 64-bit numbers, but I find the likeliness
	// of that happening to both the sequence number, the ID, and us maxing
	// out the worst-case logs to be quite unlikely, so I'm willing to live
	// with that. --Sarah
